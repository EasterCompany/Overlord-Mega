<h2 class="redline"> OVERLORD FULLSTACK WEB FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTATION </h2>
<h2> Download </h2>
<p>
  To begin you'll need to either download or clone the Overlord Repository.<br>
  On the github.com repo you can download a .zip of the latest version or alternatively you can clone the repository using "git" -> this way you can update your framework to a newer version easily at a later date. 
  To do that enter into your terminal interface:<br>
  <br>
  <code bash>git clone https://github.com/EasterCompany/Overlord.git</code>
</p>
<h2> Make a New App </h2>
<p> 
  To create a new web-app<br>while inside of the overlord directory in your terminal<br>
  Enter:<br>
  <code>./e -m hello-world</code><br>
  Or:<br>
  <code>./e make-web-app hello-world</code><br>
  <br>
  To make a web-app named "hello-world" inside the "template/app" directory.<br>
  Your new application will contain a index html document with the same name as your app; it is important that it remains this way - so if you change the name of your (web page / app) in the future make sure to rename the folder and the index html document.<br>
  Also inside of your (Web Page/App) folder you will have a "src" folder. This folder should contain a "root.py" file.
  The root.py will contain boiler plate to get you started.
